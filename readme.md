# References
Just some miscellaneous bots written in Rust for when I need a little help.

## Scripty
[scripty](https://github.com/tazz4843/scripty) is a discord bot written in Rust that transcribes audio into text. However this bot has been discontinued. Speech to Text is a feature I would like to add so that it could possibly act as secretary for [Auburn Esports](https://aub.ie/esports).

## Taliyah
[Taliyah](https://github.com/evelynmarie/Taliyah) is kitchen sink bot written in Rust. It does a lot of things and is good refenrece for some of the commands I would like to implement.
